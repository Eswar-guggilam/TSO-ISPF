**ISPF: Essential Commands to Boost Your Efficiency**

ISPF (Interactive System Productivity Facility) is a powerful mainframe editor that streamlines working with data sets on z/OS systems. Mastering its core commands can significantly enhance your productivity. This guide explores some of the most valuable ISPF commands, along with SEO-friendly content and clear explanations.

**Essential ISPF Commands:**

* **Autosave:**
    - **`AUTOSAVE ON`** (default): Automatically saves member data upon pressing F3 (END).
    - **`AUTOSAVE OFF PROMPT`**: Prompts for confirmation (save/cancel) before saving with F3.
    - **`AUTOSAVE OFF NOPROMPT`**: Requires manual `END` before saving with F3.
* **Hide Lines:**
    - Use `X` in sequence numbers to hide lines (displayed as `- - - Line(s) not Displayed`).
    - Reset to original state with `RES`.
    - Completely hide lines with `HIDE X` after hiding individual lines.
* **Flip Hidden Lines:**
    - `FLIP` reverses the hidden line list (e.g., hides all visible lines).
* **Caps Lock:**
    - Controls whether member data is stored in uppercase or lowercase.
* **Sort:**
    - Reorders lines based on specified columns.
    - Example: `SORT 12 20 D` (sort data based on columns 12-20 in descending order)
    - Can sort on multiple columns and specify ascending/descending order.

* **Search for:**
    - Locates specific text patterns within PDS members or the whole 3.4 filter.
        - Example: `SRCHFOR 'INFILE-COPYBOOK'` (find members containing "INFILE-COPYBOOK").

* **Change:**
    - Replaces text within a member.
        - Example 1 (replace first occurrence of "ibm" with "bmi"): `C/CHANGE 'ibm' 'bmi'`
        - Example 2 (replace all occurrences of "ibm" with "bmi"): `C ALL IBM BMI`
        - Useful variations:
            - `C FIRST VAR1 VAR-ONE`: Replace first occurrence.
            - `C LAST 'STOP RUN' 'GO BACK'`: Replace last occurrence.
    - Handles long strings exceeding lines.
    - Picture String Support:
        - `C ALL P'=' ' ' 01 02`: Change all characters into spaces in columns 01 and 02.
        - `C ALL P'<' P'>'` (lowercase to uppercase) or `c all p'>' p'<' 01 35` (uppercase to lowercase).
* **Find:**
    - Locates specific strings within the member, highlighting them.
        - Examples:
            - `F 'EXEC PGM='`
            - `F PREFIX 'SYS'` (find lines starting with "SYS")
            - `F SUFFIX 'OUT'` (find lines ending with "OUT")
    - Picture String Support:
        - `F P'###'` (find 3 numeric characters)
        - `F P' #'`: Numeric followed by space
        - `F P'#AB'`: Numeric character, followed by "ab"
        - `F P'#AB' 01 55`: Find in specific columns (01-55 here)
* **Find & Change (Combo):**
    - Replaces all occurrences of a string.
        - Example: Change all "dd" to "ddd"
            1. `F 'DD'` (find all "dd")
            2. `C * 'DDD'` (replace all with "ddd")
    - Equivalent to `C ALL DD DDD`.
* **Retp (History):**
    - It shows the ISPF command history for easy reuse.
    - Type `RETP` in the command field.
* **History Shortcut:**
    - Press `SHIFT+F12` repeatedly to cycle through previous commands.
* **Create & Replace:**
    - Create new members or replace existing ones using current member data.
    - Combine with line copy/move commands (`c/m`, `cc/mm`).
        - Example (create a new member "PGM2"):
            1. Select lines to copy (e.g., `CC1-10`).
            2. Use `CREATE` command.
            3. Specify the target PDS (e.g., `CREATE PGMDATA.PGM2`).
    - Use `REPLACE` instead of `CREATE` for existing members.
    - Combine with `MM-MM` to delete lines before creating/replacing.
* **Compare:**
    - Compares two members, highlighting differences in line commands.
        - Example: `COMPARE IBMUSER.JCL(PGM1)`
                    `COMPARE TEST12`
* **Clipboard:**
    - View clipboard history with `CUT DISPLAY`.
* **Highlight:**
    - `HI AUTO` Automatically highlight any type of code (COBOL, JCL, REXX,...).

* **DSLIST:**
    - Like 3.4, You can give any filters to get the datasets
        - Example: `DSLIST IBMUSER.JCL*` 
    - A simple way to get datasets without opening 3.4.

* **Bounds:**
    - Sets the left and right margins for editing specific sections of lines. '<' represents left & '>' represents right boundary for the dataset
    - Give `BOUND` in line numbers and give below cmd on ispf cmd line.
        - Example: `BOUNDS 10 40` (Adds one line to show left boundary(col 10) & right boundary(col 40) in the member)
